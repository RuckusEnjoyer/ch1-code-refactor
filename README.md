# ch1-code-refactor

## Description

This was a challenge assignment for my bootcamp course. This repo shows my knowledge on how to perform a code refactor on an existing site.

I cleaned up this code using semantic elements and made it more accessible both to fellow developers and any end users.

## Screenshot

The following 2 screenshots are a screenshot of the website.
